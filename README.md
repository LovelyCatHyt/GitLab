I use sourcetree to initialize it with command "git flow", but I don't know what happened.  
Now I create a branch called "feature/Feature0". It acts like a normal branch with a tag or something, which makes me confused.  
Now I add some special rules in .gitignore. The files in my local disks are:*Test/File0.txt, Test/File1.txt* But only *Test/File1.txt* is tracked. That means the order of the ignore rules matters. For more details, see [.gitignore](.gitignore)
